# Cascading Style Sheets

**_CSS_** is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. 

You can style, design and create almost anything with CSS. 
Here are some examples:

* alter the font 
* color
* size
* spacing of your content
* split it into multiple columns
* add animations 
* create shapes

It can be a little tricky sometimes but you can really let your imagination take over here.
