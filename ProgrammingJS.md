# Programming with JavaScript

**Control Flows**: the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

 Normally runs in order from first line in the file to the last line, unless structures like **conditionals and loop** cause it to change. 

# Functions

**Function**: (object) is a code snippet that can be called by the other code or by itself, or a variable that refers to the function. Arguments are passed as input and the function can optionally return a value. 

*identifier and scope depends on whether the name is a declaration or expression.* 

## Different types of Functions: 

* **Anonymous**: function w/o a function name. (*__only expression can be anonymous, declaration MUST have a name__*)

* **Named**: function with a name. 

* **Inner**: function inside another function. 

* **Outer**: function containing a function. 

* **Recursive**: function that calls itself. 

** Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**: function that is called directly after the functionis loaded into the browser's compiler. (*declared functions cannot be called immediately this way*)

# Operators

## Types of Operators:

* **Arithemetic**: used to perform arithmetic on **NUMBERS**

* **Assignment**: assign value to JS variables

* **String**: ( + / = ) can be used to *concatenate* strings.

* **Comparison**: used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values

* **Logical**:  used to determine the logic between variables or values.

* **Conditional**: contains a conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
