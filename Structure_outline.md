# **Web Site Building: The Outline**

Start with the basic idea and write it down! Outlines aka "Brainstorming" helps you focus in on what the key essential designs are going to be. Once you have it drawn out you can then begin the fun part....coding a layout. 

## **Wireframe: the designer's outline.**

**_Wireframe_** is a low fidelity sketch of a digital interface: basically the  bare bones of a design. There are two types if wireframes:
    
    * hand drawn sketch
    * digital

 The key is to **_Keep it simple_** so all designs start with basic fundamental shapes to represent key elements & plain colors such as white, black and grey to avoid distraction from being too detailed. 

 UX design doesn't actually start where the pen and paper meet though, it starts with thre concepts...

 1. Understanding the audience by way of user research.
 2. Define use cases via competitor & industry research. 

 ### **3 key Principles to making good wireframe**

 1. Maintain Clarity : needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs.
 
 2. Confidence : Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar. 

 3. Simplicity is KEY: make it function and get to the point, pleasentness vs fluffiness. 

 Once you have the Design and Flow where it needs to be then it's time to crack open VSC and start with the building blocks of code: HTML. If not familiar you can refer to [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).
