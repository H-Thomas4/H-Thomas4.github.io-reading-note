 Let's start with a brief introduction before getting into my thoughts about this article. My name is Heather, I am a mother of 3 teenagers, and i'm currently in the process of discovering / re-inventing myself. I have just started this new journey so this article couldn't have come at a better time. Overall, the main concept of the article is how changing the way in which you think will ultimately change your world. Sounds simple enough but like most things it takes a good bit of effort. 

>You can't teach a dog new tricks 

Many of us have a fixed way of thinking and doing things. Some of this has been brought about from how we were taught, what we have seen and also what we have experienced. The issue with having this mindset is that as much as we think we are "doing it right" we really are limiting our full potential. Allowing ourselves to implement a growth mindset not only helps stop the self-sabotaging thought processes that spill into our actions, but also gives us the techniques that can improve all areas of ours lives, not just our thinking, which ultimately can lead to our success. 

```
Signs of a Fixed Mindset
```
* When a challenge or obstacle presents itself you either get flustered with it and give up, avoid it altogether or lose focus and delay it. 
* When faced with the options of putting in an effort and being uncomfortable, or staying in your comfort zone you choose Comfort. 
* When you see other's success as a threat or tend to be jealous of their accomplishments.
*  Ignores constructive criticism. 

I know what you are thinking, I too thought the same thing... " I can relate to some if not all of these things." :worried: The good news is now that we are aware of it we can begin the process of changing it. The Growth Mindset is the process of recognizing when you are in this "fixed" frame of mind and taking actions to reverse and make it into a positive mindset therefore being more productive and successful.

As I stated earlier I am on a journey to grow. I have already faced obstacles along the way and I know there are plenty more to come. This article helped me recognize areas I may have overlooked and where I need to be more diligent in my actions. The following are a few ways I plan to incorporate the Growth Mindset into my personal life: 

1. Instead of letting my nerves get the best of me when faced with a challenge, I am going to cut out the distractions and embrace it as a learning opportunity to grow. 
2. Instead of taking criticism personally as though I am not enough, I am going to accept it as love and support from someone who sees in me the potential I may not see in myself yet. I am going to celebrate the small victories and accomplishments and stop being my own tough critic. 
3. I am going to push myself outside my comfort zone and keep in mind the rewards to come versus the instand gratification that comes with comfort. 

 .........and of course remember.............
